##Origin
I wanted a colorscheme that worked well as long-term use and wasn't that heavy on the eyes. I searched a while and didn't find any that fit my needs/liked. So i decided to make my own.

##Features
* Colors are torwards the green side, with a bit of blue.
* Designed to have low/soft contrast to lower eye-strain
* Created with alot of love
* Extensible and very Customizable incase anyone wants to change it.
* Also avalible for the "Kitty" terminal.
